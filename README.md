This is the website for the *AI agents* class (CS 839, Spring 2026) at UW-Madison.

<summary>Class structure</summary>

This is a seminar style class.

In the first week, the instructor will provide an overview of the AI agents space. In subsequent weeks, students will present research papers. Each lecture will include two presentations (25min per presentation, with ~10min of discussion afterward). All students are expected to read the papers that will be presented.

A bulk of the grade will be a research project on AI agents. Immediately start thinking about project ideas. You are encouraged to work with a partner. You will submit a 1 page project proposal by Feb 24. I will send out some project ideas as well. The final project is due on the last day of exams.

<summary>Advice for presentations</summary>

You will be assigned a paper (or more) during the semester to present. Your goal is to:
1. explain the work in detail
2. put the work in the context of the literature (this will involve reading other papers)
3. describe what you think of the paper -- writing, limitations, future prospects, etc.
